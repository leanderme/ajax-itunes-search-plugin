> Alert: This plugin is no longer under active development, because I no longer work on WP / PHP projects. This plugin was one of my first. There aren't any tests included and I'm sure that the coding style breaks common conventions. Use on your own risk. I don’t intend to do any WordPress-related work in the future.

Did you ever wanted to share your favourite iTunes playlist with others? Have you ever tried to collect the best songs of your favourite genre but failed when finding people who share the same taste? Then Ajax iTunes Search is the plugin you have been looking for! Ajax iTunes Search communicates with the iTunes Search API and allows users of your site to submit their favourite songs in real time. When doing so, only the title of the song or the artist is necessary. Everything else is automatically generated! Of course, you as administrator still have full control of what is submitted. A powerful admin backend lets you even adapt the style of Ajax iTunes Search, ensuring that it fits perfectly to your design.
